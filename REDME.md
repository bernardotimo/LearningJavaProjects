# Learning Java Projects ☕🚀

This repository is a **Java Learning Lab** designed to consolidate knowledge through **small, focused experiments**.  
Each class represents a practical exercise created while learning core Java concepts, evolving incrementally from fundamentals to more advanced topics.

This is not a collection of finished products, but a **structured learning trajectory** with real code, clear intent, and continuous improvement.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Transform theoretical Java concepts into **executable code**
- Practice consistently through **small, atomic exercises**
- Build a **transparent learning history** via Git commits
- Establish a solid foundation for future **modular and scalable projects**
